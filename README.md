DarkVision is an AI-powered reconnaissance platform designed as the ultimate sidekick for offensive security professionals like red teamers and penetration testers.

It tackles the most time-consuming and manual parts of a security assessment: data gathering and analysis. Instead of spending hours sifting through information, you can use DarkVision to automate complex recon tasks with a single click.

With our suite of tools, you can:

    Analyze Anything Visually: Drop in a screenshot of a web app, a network diagram, or even a PDF, and our AI will instantly identify vulnerabilities, drawing interactive boxes directly on the image to show you exactly where the risk is.

    Conduct Deep OSINT: Turn a simple domain name into a comprehensive target profile, complete with the technology stack, potential employee contacts, and public security findings. It then goes a step further by generating a step-by-step, actionable attack playbook based on its discoveries.

    Automate Specialized Tasks: Instantly generate highly convincing phishing emails with spam filter analysis, analyze raw source code to map the attack surface, or even run a fully-scoped bug hunting mission that documents every action in a legal audit trail.

What makes DarkVision unique is its focus on a seamless, professional workflow. Every report is structured, paginated like a book for easy reading, and can be cryptographically "locked" into an Evidence Locker, ensuring the integrity of your findings for official reports.

In short, DarkVision is a force multiplier. It automates the tedious work so security professionals can focus on what they do best: finding and exploiting critical vulnerabilities faster and more effectively than ever before.
